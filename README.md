# PostEnrollmentTimetabling

## Problem Description

Post-Enrollment Timetabling is a course scheduling method used mainly in universities and large educational institutions. Instead of creating the timetable first and forcing students to adapt, the PET approach collects studentsâ€™ enrollment choices (courses, modules, or classes) before the timetable is generated. The scheduling system then uses these actual registrations to build a timetable that maximizes student satisfaction and resource usage.

**The problem's hard constraints are:**
* Each event must be scheduled in a timeslot and a room.
* Events with common students must be placed at different timeslots.
* A room can host at most one event in each timeslot.
* The capacity and feature requirements of each event must be met by the room that will eventually host it.
* Certain timeslot requirements may apply to specific events.
* There may be relationships of precedence between events.

**On the other hand, the soft constraints are:**
* A student attends an event at the last timeslot of a day.
* A student attends three (or more) events in a row on the same day.
* A student attends only one event in a day.
One penalty point is imposed for each of the conditions above.

## Penalty Calculation (Soft Constraints)

The total penalty is calculated as the sum of three types of violations
for all students across all days:

#### 1. Event in the last timeslot of a day
For each student `s`:
- +1 penalty for every event scheduled in the last timeslot of a day.

\[
P_{1}(s) = \sum_{e \in E_s} \mathbf{1}\{t(e) = \text{last}(d(e))\}
\]

---

#### 2. Three (or more) consecutive events in a day
For each student `s`:
- +1 penalty for every occurrence of three (or more) consecutive events
  on the same day.

\[
P_{2}(s) = \sum_{d} \sum_{\text{consecutive } (e_1,e_2,e_3) \subseteq E_s \text{ on day } d} \mathbf{1}\{\text{consecutive timeslots}\}
\]

---

#### 3. Only one event in a day
For each student `s`:
- +1 penalty if the student has exactly one event scheduled that day.

\[
P_{3}(s) = \sum_{d} \mathbf{1}\{|E_s \cap \{e : d(e) = d\}| = 1\}
\]

---

#### Total Penalty
The final penalty is the sum of all three components for all students:

\[
\text{Penalty} = \sum_{s \in S} \Big( P_{1}(s) + P_{2}(s) + P_{3}(s) \Big)
\]
