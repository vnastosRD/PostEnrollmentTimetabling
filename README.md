# PostEnrollmentTimetabling

### Problem Description

Post-Enrollment Timetabling is a course scheduling method used mainly in universities and large educational institutions. Instead of creating the timetable first and forcing students to adapt, the PET approach collects studentsâ€™ enrollment choices (courses, modules, or classes) before the timetable is generated. The scheduling system then uses these actual registrations to build a timetable that maximizes student satisfaction and resource usage.
